I'm applying for the position of Software Engineer Intern.

    I'll  obtain a Bachelor's Degree in June 2013. I've spent this year working as a Software Engineer. During this time
I've developed lots of code in Java. I've been studying algorithms at
my free time, implementing them in C++ and/or sometimes in Python. As a
hobby I've written several networking applications in plain C under
the Linux OS. I have been using Linux as a desktop for several years  now, so I
am an experienced user.

   I really like that my work is useful for people and I think this position
will give me an oppotunity to help a lot of people. I believe that
I could be valuable for your team and as I have good communication skills
I will find it easy to fit in.

   I look forward to hearing from you to discuss my application. You can contact me by email at kremsnx@gmail.com or by phone at +7(985)964-85-12.



Yours sincerely,
Valeriy Ovchinnikov
