I'm applying for a position of Software Engineer Intern.

    I'll be graduated MIPT with a Bachelor of Science Degree in June 2013. I've spent last year working as a Software Engineer. During this time
I've developed lots of code in Java. I've been studying algorithms at
my free time, implementing them in C++ and/or sometimes in Python. As a
hobby I've written several networking applications in plain C under
the Linux OS. I use Linux as a desktop for several years by now so I
am an experienced user.
